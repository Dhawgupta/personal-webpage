I am a MSc student at the RLAI lab working with Martha White on different aspects of Reinforcement Learning. In general I am interested in developing online learning systems which can adapt to the environement by actively collecting data and approximating control.

I have been a big fan of robotics and in general science fiction. I would like to participate in any wild thought experiment, be it  how the situtation of human society with the advancaments in learning systems. I am also up for games be it board or video.
